# This file is an example of a Perl::Critic configuration file.  This
# file is usually called ".perlcriticrc" and is usually located in
# your home directory or the working directory of your project.
# However, you can use the -profile option to tell Perl::Critic use a
# different file in another location.
#
# The area before any of the [Perl::Critic::Policy] sections is used
# to set default values for the arguments to the Perl::Critic engine.
# If you are using the "perlcritic" program, you can override these
# settings at the command-line.  Or if you are using the Perl::Critic
# library, your API arguments will override these settings as well.
