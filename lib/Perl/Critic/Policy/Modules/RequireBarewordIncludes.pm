=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::RequireBarewordIncludes - Write C<require Module> instead of C<require 'Module.pm'>.


=head1 AFFILIATION

This Policy is part of the core L<Perl::Critic|Perl::Critic>
distribution.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

When including another module (or library) via the C<require> or
C<use> statements, it is best to identify the module (or library)
using a bareword rather than an explicit path.  This is because paths
are usually not portable from one machine to another.  Also, Perl
automatically assumes that the filename ends in '.pm' when the library
is expressed as a bareword.  So as a side-effect, this Policy
encourages people to write '*.pm' modules instead of the old-school
'*.pl' libraries.

    use 'My/Perl/Module.pm';  #not ok
    use My::Perl::Module;     #ok


=head1 CONFIGURATION

This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.


=head1 NOTES

This Policy is a replacement for C<ProhibitRequireStatements>, which
completely banned the use of C<require> for the sake of eliminating
the old '*.pl' libraries from Perl4.  Upon further consideration, I
realized that C<require> is quite useful and necessary to enable
run-time loading.  Thus, C<RequireBarewordIncludes> does allow you to
use C<require>, but still encourages you to write '*.pm' modules.

Sometimes, you may want to load modules at run-time, but you don't
know at design-time exactly which module you will need to load
(L<Perl::Critic|Perl::Critic> is an example of this).  In that case,
just attach the C<'## no critic'> annotation like so:

    require $module_name;  ## no critic

Chris Dolan <cdolan@cpan.org> was instrumental in identifying the
correct motivation for and behavior of this Policy.  Thanks Chris.
