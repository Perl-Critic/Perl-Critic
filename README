NAME
    Perl::Critic - Critique Perl source for style and standards

SYNOPSIS
      use Perl::Critic;

      #Create Critic and load Policies from default config file
      $critic = Perl::Critic->new();

      #Create Critic and load only the most important Polices
      $critic = Perl::Critic->new(-priority => 1);

      #Create Critic and load Policies from specific config file
      $critic = Perl::Critic->new(-profile => $file);

      #Create Critic and load Policy by hand
      $critic = Perl::Critic->new(-profile => 'NONE');
      $critic->add_policy('MyPolicyModule');

      #Analyze code for policy violations
      @violations = $critic->critique($source_code);

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
    standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code
    analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of
    Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding
    guidelines. Most Policies are based on Damian Conway's book Perl Best
    Practices. You can choose and customize those Polices through the
    Perl::Critic interface. You can also create new Policy modules that suit
    your own tastes.

    For a convenient command-line interface to Perl::Critic, see the
    documentation for perlcritic. If you want to integrate Perl::Critic with
    your build process, Test::Perl::Critic provides a nice interface that is
    suitable for test scripts.

CONSTRUCTOR
    new ( [ -profile => $FILE, -priority => $N, -include => \@PATTERNS,
     -exclude => \@PATTERNS, -force => 1 ] )
            Returns a reference to a new Perl::Critic object. Most arguments
            are just passed directly into Perl::Critic::Config, but I have
            described them here as well. All arguments are optional
            key-value pairs as follows:

            -profile is a path to a configuration file. If $FILE is not
            defined, Perl::Critic::Config attempts to find a .perlcriticrc
            configuration file in the current directory, and then in your
            home directory. Alternatively, you can set the "PERLCRITIC"
            environment variable to point to a file in another location. If
            a configuration file can't be found, or if $FILE is an empty
            string, then it defaults to include all the Policy modules that
            ship with Perl::Critic. See "CONFIGURATION" for more
            information.

            -priority is the maximum priority value of Policies that should
            be added to the Perl::Critic::Config. 1 is the "highest"
            priority, and all numbers larger than 1 have "lower" priority.
            Once the user-preferences have been read from the "-profile",
            All Policies that are configured with a priority greater than $N
            will be removed from this Config. For a given "-profile",
            increasing $N will result in more Policy violations. The default
            "-priority" is 1. See "CONFIGURATION" for more information.

            -include is a reference to a list of @PATTERNS. Once the
            user-preferences have been read from the "-profile", all
            Policies that do not match at least one "m/$PATTERN/imx" will be
            removed from this Config. Using the "-include" option causes the
            <-priority> option to be ignored.

            -exclude is a reference to a list of @PATTERNS. Once the
            user-preferences have been read from the "-profile", all
            Policies that match at least one "m/$PATTERN/imx" will be
            removed from the Config. Using the "-exclude" option causes the
            <-priority> option to be ignored. The "-exclude" patterns are
            applied after the <-include> patterns, therefore, the "-exclude"
            patterns take precedence.

            -force controls whether Perl::Critic observes the magical ""no
            critic"" pseudo-pragmas in your code. If set to a true value,
            Perl::Critic will analyze all code. If set to a false value
            (which is the default) Perl::Critic will overlook code that is
            tagged with these comments. See "BENDING THE RULES" for more
            information.

METHODS
    add_policy( -policy => $STRING [, -config => \%HASH ] )
            Loads a Policy into this Critic engine. The engine will attempt
            to "require" the module named by $STRING and instantiate it. If
            the module fails to load or cannot be instantiated, it will
            throw a warning and return a false value. Otherwise, it returns
            a reference to this Critic engine.

            -policy is the name of a Perl::Critic::Policy subclass module.
            The 'Perl::Critic::Policy' portion of the name can be omitted
            for brevity. This argument is required.

            -config is an optional reference to a hash of Policy
            configuration parameters (Note that this is not a
            Perl::Critic::Config object). The contents of this hash
            reference will be passed into to the constructor of the Policy
            module. See the documentation in the relevant Policy module for
            a description of the arguments it supports.

    critique( $source_code )
            Runs the $source_code through the Perl::Critic engine using all
            the policies that have been loaded into this engine. If
            $source_code is a scalar reference, then it is treated as string
            of actual Perl code. Otherwise, it is treated as a path to a
            file containing Perl code. Returns a list of
            Perl::Critic::Violation objects for each violation of the loaded
            Policies. The list is sorted in the order that the Violations
            appear in the code. If there are no violations, returns an empty
            list.

    policies( void )
            Returns a list containing references to all the Policy objects
            that have been loaded into this engine. Objects will be in the
            order that they were loaded.

CONFIGURATION
    The default configuration file is called .perlcriticrc.
    Perl::Critic::Config will look for this file in the current directory
    first, and then in your home directory. Alternatively, you can set the
    PERLCRITIC environment variable to explicitly point to a different file
    in another location. If none of these files exist, and the "-profile"
    option is not given to the constructor, Perl::Critic::Config defaults to
    include all the policies that are shipped with Perl::Critic.

    The format of the configuration file is a series of named sections that
    contain key-value pairs separated by '='. Comments should start with '#'
    and can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value pairs if
    you desire. The general recipe is a series of blocks like this:

        [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
        priority = 1
        arg1 = value1
        arg2 = value2

    "Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName" is the full name of a
    module that implements the policy. The Policy modules distributed with
    Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the table of
    contents in Damian Conway's book Perl Best Practices. For brevity, you
    can omit the 'Perl::Critic::Policy' part of the module name. All Policy
    modules must be a subclass of Perl::Critic::Policy.

    "priority" is the level of importance you wish to assign to this policy.
    1 is the "highest" priority level, and all numbers greater than 1 have
    increasingly "lower" priority. Only those policies with a priority less
    than or equal to the "-priority" value given to the constructor will be
    loaded. The priority can be an arbitrarily large positive integer. If
    the priority is not defined, it defaults to 1.

    The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters for that
    specific Policy and will be passed into the constructor of the
    Perl::Critic::Policy subclass. The constructors for most Policy modules
    do not support arguments, and those that do should have reasonable
    defaults. See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for
    more details.

    By default, all the policies that are distributed with Perl::Critic are
    added to the Config. Rather than assign a priority level to a Policy,
    you can simply "turn off" a Policy by prepending a '-' to the name of
    the module in the config file. In this manner, the Policy will never be
    loaded, regardless of the "-priority" given to the constructor.

    A simple configuration might look like this:

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # These are really important, so always load them

        [TestingAndDebugging::RequirePackageStricture]
        priority = 1

        [TestingAndDebugging::RequirePackageWarnings]
        priority = 1

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # These are less important, so only load when asked

        [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
        priority = 2

        [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
        priority = 2

        #--------------------------------------------------------------
        # I do not agree with these, so never load them

        [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseVars]
        [-NamingConventions::ProhibitMixedCaseSubs]

THE POLICIES
    The following Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic. The
    Policy modules have been categorized according to the table of contents
    in Damian Conway's book Perl Best Practices. Since most coding standards
    take the form "do this..." or "don't do that...", I have adopted the
    convention of naming each module "RequireSomething" or
    "ProhibitSomething". See the documentation of each module for it's
    specific details.

BENDING THE RULES
    NOTE: This feature changed in version 0.09 and is not backward
    compatible with earlier versions.

    Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you comply
    or you don't. In the real world, it is not always practical (or even
    possible) to fully comply with coding standards. In such cases, it is
    wise to show that you are knowingly violating the standards and that you
    have a Damn Good Reason (DGR) for doing so.

    To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore
    certain lines or blocks of code by using pseudo-pragmas:

        require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no critic
        require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no critic

        for my $element (@list) {

            ## no critic

            $foo = "";               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
            $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
            #Some more evil code...

            ## use critic

            #Some good code...
            do_something($_);
        }

    The "## no critic" comments direct Perl::Critic to overlook the
    remaining lines of code until the end of the current block, or until a
    "## use critic" comment is found (whichever comes first). If the "## no
    critic" comment is on the same line as a code statement, then only that
    line of code is overlooked. To direct perlcritic to ignore the "## no
    critic" comments, use the "-force" option.

    Use this feature wisely. "## no critic" should be used in the smallest
    possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. If Perl::Critic
    complains about your code, try and find a compliant solution before
    resorting to this feature.

EXTENDING THE CRITIC
    The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the
    addition of new Policies. To create a new Policy, make a subclass of
    Perl::Critic::Policy and override the "violates()" method. Your module
    should go somewhere in the Perl::Critic::Policy namespace. To use the
    new Policy, just add it to your .perlcriticrc file. You'll need to have
    some understanding of PPI, but most Policy modules are pretty
    straightforward and only require about 20 lines of code.

    If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them to
    <thaljef@cpan.org> and I'll be happy to put them into the Perl::Critic
    distribution.

IMPORTANT CHANGES
    As new Policy modules were added to Perl::Critic, the overall
    performance started to deteriorate rapidly. Since each module would
    traverse the document (several times for some modules), a lot of time
    was spent iterating over the same document nodes. So starting in version
    0.11, I have switched to a stream-based approach where the document is
    traversed once and every Policy module is tested at each node. The
    result is roughly 300% a improvement. Unfortunately, Policy modules
    prior to version 0.11 won't be compatible. Hopefully, few people have
    started creating their own Policy modules. Converting them to the
    stream-based model is fairly easy, and actually results in somewhat
    cleaner code. Look at the ControlStrucutres::* modules for some
    examples.

PREREQUISITES
    Perl::Critic requires the following modules:

    PPI

    Config::Tiny

    File::Spec

    List::Util

    List::MoreUtils

    Pod::Usage

    Pod::PlainText

    IO::String

    String::Format

    The following modules are optional, but recommended for complete
    testing:

    Test::Pod

    Test::Pod::Coverage

    Test::Perl::Critic

BUGS
    Scrutinizing Perl code is hard for humans, let alone machines. If you
    find any bugs, particularly false-positives or false-negatives from a
    Perl::Critic::Policy, please submit them to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Perl-Critic>. Thanks.
